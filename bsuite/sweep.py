"""This module exposes the bsuite experiment definitions in terms of bsuite_ids.

Each bsuite_id is designed to be a human readable string in the format:

    environment_name/i

where i is the index of the setting in that experiments sweep.py file.

Each bsuite_id can be used to load an environment, via the bsuite.load*
functions.

To iterate over the bsuite_ids for all experiments, use `sweep.SWEEP`.

To iterate over the bsuite_ids for a single experiment, use
`sweep.<EXPERIMENT_NAME>``. For example, `sweep.DISCOUNTING_CHAIN`.

To iterate over the bsuite_ids for a single experiment type, use
`sweep.TAGS[<EXPERIMENT_TAG>]`. For example, `sweep.TAGS['memory'].
