"""Analysis for deep sea stochastic.

We say that a deep sea episode is 'bad' when the agent takes a move 'left'
while it on the 'optimal' trajectory. However, for the stochastic case this
means that the agent can have few 'bad' trajectories just by luck of the
environment noise. To make sure that this is not by dumb luck, we use a more
stringent threshold and only once the agent has done at least 100 episodes.
