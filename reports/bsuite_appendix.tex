%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BSUITE REPORT TEMPLATE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Use this LaTeX code to generate an automatic bsuite appendix for your paper
% submission. First \input{bsuite_preamble} before your \begin{document}.
% You can use the bsuite_preamble to define the location of your plots, plus a 
% link to the full bsuite comments.
%
% Then, write a short description of your agents in app:bsuite-agents, and a short
% commentary on your results in app:bsuite-commentary.
%
% For some conference formats (e.g. ICLR) it is important to allow margin change
% \includepackage{geometry}, we do not include this in the preamble by default.

% AGENT DEFINITION [EDIT]
%
% Use this section to provide a brief overview of the agents that you run on
% bsuite. Usually this will involve links to full descriptions elsewhere in 
% your paper.

\subsection{Agent definition}
\label{app:bsuite-agents}
In this experiment all implementations are taken from \url{github.com/deepmind/bsuite/baselines} with default configurations.
We provide a brief summary of the agents run on \bsuiteversion:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
    \item {\bf random}: selects action uniformly at random each timestep.
    \item {\bf dqn}: Deep Q-networks \cite{mnih2015human}.
    \item {\bf boot\_dqn}: bootstrapped DQN with prior networks \cite{osband2016deep,osband2018rpf}.
    \item {\bf actor\_critic\_rnn}: an actor critic with recurrent neural network \cite{mnih2016asynchronous}.
\end{itemize}

% SUMMARY SCORES [DO NOT EDIT]
\subsection{Summary scores}
\label{app:bsuite-scores}

Each \bsuite\ experiment outputs a summary score in [0,1].
We aggregate these scores by according to key experiment type, according to the standard analysis notebook.
A detailed analysis of each of these experiments may be found in a notebook hosted on Colaboratory: \bsuitecolab.

% RESULTS COMMENTARY [EDIT]

\subsection{Results commentary}
\label{app:bsuite-commentary}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item {\bf random} performs poorly across all aspects.
    This confirms that our scoring functions are working as intended.
    \item {\bf dqn} performs well on basic tasks, and quite well on credit assignment, generalization, noise and scale.
    DQN performs extremely poorly across memory and exploration tasks.
    The feedforward MLP has no mechanism for memory, and $\epsilon$=5\%-greedy action selection is notoriously inefficient in domains that require efficient exploration.
    \item {\bf boot\_dqn} performs mostly identically to DQN, except for exploration where it greatly outperforms, and also a smaller boost to performance under noise.
    This result matches our understanding of Bootstrapped DQN as a variant of DQN designed to estimate uncertainty and use this to guide deep exploration.
    \item {\bf actor\_critic\_rnn} typically performs worse than either DQN or Bootstrapped DQN on all tasks apart from memory.
    This agent is the only one able to perform better than random due to its recurrent network architecture.
\end{itemize}
