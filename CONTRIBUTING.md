## Process to add new experiments in BSuite:
1.  If you're creating a completely new environment, create a directory in `bsuite/environments` with: `<env>.py`. `<env>.py` should define a new env_class which should be a subclass of `bsuite.environments.base.Environment` (and it should return appropriate info in `bsuite_info()`).

1.  Create directory in `bsuite/experiments` with: `<exp>.py`, `sweep.py`, `analysis.py`, `__init__.py`, `<exp>_test.py`.
    *  `<exp>.py`: Needs to import the environment used for the experiment that is defined in `bsuite/environments/`
    *  `<env>.py` and define a load variable in the file that is equal to `<env_class`, i.e., `load = <env>.<env_class>`
    *  `sweep.py`: Needs to have the parameters that vary for the experiment. e.g., `seed` and `noise_scale` for `cartpole_noise`. Each set of parameters is stored as a dict in a tuple named `SETTINGS`. This file also defines `NUM_EPISODES` and `TAGS` (such as `credit_assignment`, `basic`, `exploration`, etc.). In `TAGS`, the 1st tag should be one of the basic "types" from `summary_analysis.py`: `['basic', 'noise', 'scale', 'exploration', 'credit_assignment', 'memory', 'mdp_playground']`. NOTE: Remember to add a comma after the tag in `TAGS` if there is only 1 tag, because the comma is what makes it a tuple in Python.
    *  `analysis.py`: Needs to define `score()`, `plot_learning()`, `plot_seeds()` (and possibly other functions like `plot_average`) that will be used by `bsuite/analysis/results.ipynb` to analyse and plot recorded data.

1.  `bsuite/bsuite.py`, `bsuite/sweep.py`, `bsuite/experiments/summary_analysis.py` and `bsuite/analysis/results.ipynb` need to be modified for each new experiment added. We need to add code lines specific to the new experiment, e.g., `from bsuite.experiments.<exp> import ...`.

1. Run `pytest` in bsuite directory and ensure no tests fail.

1. Run `pytype -j "$(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo)" bsuite` in bsuite directory and ensure no tests fail.
